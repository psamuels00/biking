# TODO

### High Priority
- Simplify deployment.  Make README static.  Simplify README.

### Medium Priority
- Make sure show_only_tracked_days still works.
- Reorg files so output/ contains only generated files.
- Fix the default journal file for project and update README.
- Define all configuration values in one place.
- Generate page mapping day number to date as mitigation for adding better date labels..
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30   1 Jan   5
- Tweak the Performance Index calculation so short, high-elevation gain rides with little flat land score
  as high as long, not-quite-as-high-elevation gain rides with more flat land.  The latter is scoring
  higher because of the higher speed achieved due to less elevation gain.

### Low Priority
- Maybe separate legends from graphs as a separate image??
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.
