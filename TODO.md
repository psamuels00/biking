# TODO

### High Priority
- Tweak power and energy estimations.  Strava reports higher numbers.  The bikecalculator.com indicates even higher.
  Update explanation of estimated metrics in README.

### Medium Priority
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.

### Low Priority
- Modify InputData.summarize() to also report power, energy, pi, calories, and ride rate
- Maybe save graph legends separately from the graphs??
- Generate green_legend.jpg automatically (maybe using imgkit and wkhtmltoimage)
