# TODO

### High Priority
_None_

### Medium Priority
- Fix the default journal file for project and update README.
- Automatically publish new graphs.
- Define all configuration values in one place.
- Make sure show_only_tracked_days still works.
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30   1 Jan   5

### Low Priority
- Maybe separate legends from graphs as a separate image??
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.
