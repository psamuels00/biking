# TODO

### High Priority
- Ensure no overlap in X-axis tick labels

### Medium Priority
- Completely separate configuration from the code
- Add support for multiple activities per day
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30   1 Jan   5
