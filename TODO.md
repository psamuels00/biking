# TODO

### High Priority
- If performance factor is zero, do not include the factor in the legend
- Don't draw grid over bars in bar chart
- Fix x-axis labels, ensure far-right column labeled as day "1"
- Update explanation of estimated metrics in README

### Medium Priority
- Add --summary option to call InputData.summarize() and exit
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.

### Low Priority
- Maybe save graph legends separately from the graphs??
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30   1 Jan   5
- Generate green_legend.jpg automatically (maybe using imgkit and wkhtmltoimage)
- Add option to summarize input, writing to CSV file
