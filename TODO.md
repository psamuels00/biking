# TODO

### High Priority
_None_

### Medium Priority
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.
- Allow weight and maybe other parameters to be overridden in the journal file

### Low Priority
- Maybe show time as hh:mm:ss instead of minutes
- Create formula images using latex for the description of power estimation in README
- Sort Inputs and Metrics tables by selected column, ascending/descending
- Generate green_legend.jpg automatically somehow
- Maybe save graph legends separately from the graphs??
