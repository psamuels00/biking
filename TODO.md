# TODO

### High Priority
- Update Stats.show() to include power, energy, pi, calories, and ride rate and to support CSV

### Medium Priority
- Generate stat summaries as HTML, possibly combining 30/60/90/all into a single page.
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.

### Low Priority
- Generate green_legend.jpg automatically somehow
- Maybe save graph legends separately from the graphs??
