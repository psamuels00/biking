# TODO

- Fix the elevation start hack (see README > Elevation)
- Completely separate configuration from the code
- Simplify input.py by relying on activities manually added to Strava
- Add support for multiple activities per day
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30 1 Jan   5

- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs
