# TODO

### High Priority
_None_

### Medium Priority
- Improve the Performance Index calculation.

### Low Priority
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs.
- If performance factor is zero, do not include the factor in the legend
- Change elevation gain rate factor to 0.  Update equations and explanation in README.
- Maybe save graph legends separately from the graphs??
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30   1 Jan   5
- Generate green_legend.jpg automatically (maybe using imgkit and wkhtmltoimage)
