# TODO

### High Priority
_None_

### Medium Priority
- Allow power and performance parameters to be overridden in the journal file, for a single day or all days henceforth
- Move Strava-estimated power to a separate graph
- Pull segment data for each activity so it is cached and available for analysis.
- Group rides by route, using activity metrics and segment info
- Create separate graphs for specific segments
- Add timeline markers to graphs
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs and metrics summaries.

### Low Priority
- Maybe show time as hh:mm:ss instead of minutes
- Create formula images using latex for the description of power estimation in README
- Sort Inputs and Metrics tables by selected column, ascending/descending
- Generate green_legend.jpg automatically somehow
