# TODO

### High Priority
- Pull multiple pages of activity data from Strava, not just the first one

### Medium Priority
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30   1 Jan   5

- Completely separate configuration from the code
- Add support for multiple activities per day
- Simplify input: maybe add activities manually via Strava, or at least make it easier to enter data manually

### Low Priority
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs
- Make the graphs interactive!?
- Add a spreadsheet, word processor, and AI chat!!? _(just kidding)_
