# TODO

- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30 1 Jan   5

- Completely separate configuration from the code
- Add support for multiple activities per day
- Simplify input.py: maybe add activities manually via Strava
  or at least make it easier to enter data manually
- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs
- Make the graphs interactive!?
- Add a spreadsheet, word processor, and AI chat!!?
