# TODO

- Fix the data for 2024-12-22 (day 73), which is wonky because I forgot to start recording in Strava until after
  the big climb to Black Diamond Mines.  This means the starting elevation is off.  The starting elevation may be
  the elevation high, unless the privacy settings are interfering.
- Fix the elevation start hack (see README > Elevation)
- Completely separate configuration from the code
- Simplify input.py by relying on activities manually added to Strava
- Add support for multiple activities per day
- Add date labels somehow instead of day number, for example:

      | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
          1 Dec   5        10        15        20        25        30 1 Jan   5

- Add Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly rollup graphs
- Make the graphs interactive!?
